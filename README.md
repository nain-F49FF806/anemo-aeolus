>    Aer is a private local storage utility application for android.
>    Instead of being a stand-alone file manager user interface, it hooks into various components of
>    Android making it feel like a native part of the operative system.
>    Moreover it provides ways for the user to export contents from other apps and save them as files.
>
>    ## Features
>
>    - Create folders and organize files freely
>    - All files in the private storage won't appear in the other apps
>    - Access in the system Files application (the _DocumentsProviderUI_)
>        - An optional shortcut for devices that do not expose the system Files app is offered
>    - Lock access to the private storage
>    - Quick tile
>    - Auto lock after 15 minutes
>    - Password for locking access to the files
>    - Import content using the share Android functionality
>
